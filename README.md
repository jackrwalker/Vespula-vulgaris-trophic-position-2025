Data associated with manuscript titled: "Trophic position of common wasps (Vespula vulgaris) is resilient to urbanisation"

1. Trophic.position_data variables:

site: field site ID
sample: sample number
samplecat: indicates the sample size for each site, whereby a = 1-2 samples, b = 3-4 samples, c = 5-6 samples. used for producing Figure 2.
urban: urbanisation measured as % impervious surface cover
city: the city that site was located in
daterun: date that the sample was analysed 
alaphe: trophic position calculated using the trophic amnino acid alanine and the source amino acid phenylalanine
gluphe: trophic position calculated using the trophic amnino acid glutamic acid and the source amino acid phenylalanine
ala,val,leu,gly,nle,pro,asp,glu,phe: δ15N (‰) values for the amino acids alanine, valine, leucine, glycine, proline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine

2. grass.height_data variables:

site: field site ID
quadrat: number of quadrat (1-15) that grass height was measured from
grass.height1, grass.height2, grass.height3, grass.height4: one measurement was taken from each corner of each quadrat, each column contains a measurement from one corner
mea.grass.height: mean grass height for each quadrat

3. woodland.cover.300m_data variables:

site: field site ID
woodland.cover: Area (m2) of deciduous woodland cover within a 300m radius of the point from which wasps were collected
